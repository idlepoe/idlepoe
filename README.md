Creating apps is one of my hobbies.  
When I come up with an interesting idea, I don’t hesitate to jump right into implementation.  
I frequently explore new technologies and libraries, learning by applying them directly to projects.

Since leaving my previous job, I’ve developed the following apps:

- **Seoul Events** – Displays various cultural events (exhibitions, performances, festivals, etc.) happening in Seoul  
  GitHub: [https://github.com/idlepoe/seoul_event](https://github.com/idlepoe/seoul_event) *

- **Ulala** – A social app that lets users share YouTube music clips and listen to the same segment together

- **Jinpoommukpoom** – A social quiz app where users guess the price of food based on photos
